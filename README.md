Solve Multy-dimensional knapsack problem with Genetic Algorithm.

At the LibGen.py you can see my usage of pyeasyga package for solving Multy-dimensional knapsack problem.
At the MyGen.py you can see my realisation of Genetic Algorithm according my variant: 1.2 (my number 33), 2.1 (I am a girl), 4.3 (the end of my number is 3), 3.2 (my number 33), 5.2 (I am at the secong group).

At the images res.png and res_con.png you can see 10 resualts of package and my algorithm work. The best resualts I send to the server, witch you can see at the send.py.

The MyBag.py is the module witch call all need functions and print the resaults on the screen.
